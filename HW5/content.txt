Asus TUF Dash F15 Laptop: Ampere with one foot on the brakeNot much faster than Turing. Asus put the slowest currently available GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU into its brand-new TUF Dash F15. Find out in our test what this means for performance, power consumption, and emissions (noise, temperature, etc).Florian Glaser, 👁 Florian Glaser (translated by Finn D.

 🇫🇷 🇪🇸 🇵🇹 🇷🇺 🇮🇹 🇸🇪 Gaming Geforce Tiger Lake Laptop






Unsurprisingly, various TUF Dash F15 SKUs are going to be available. That is of course once Nvidia’s Ampere chips become available in the first place. Its quad-core processor is based on Intel’s brand-new Tiger Lake generation, and the three choices available include the Core i5-11300H (max 4.4 GHz), the Core i7-11370H (max 4.8 GHz), and the Core i7-11375H (max 5.0 GHz). The selection of GPUs will include a GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop and GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop. Three different 15-inch displays will be available, one with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 and a refresh rate of 165 Hz and two with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and a refresh rate of either 240 or 144 Hz. According to the specs, the 144 Hz panel will offer the narrowest color gamut of the three and should therefore best be avoided. And last but not least up to 16 GB of RAM, part of which is soldered onto the motherboard, and up to 1 TB of SSD storage space will be available as well.Our review unit came equipped with a Core i7-11370H, a GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop, the 240 Hz display, 16 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB SSD. This particular configuration will set you back more than 2,000 Euros (US prices not yet available), which is a lot considering that the TUF-series used to be the Asus’s entry-level series of gaming laptops. However, we should note that case quality improved significantly over the course of its lifetime and is no longer made exclusively out of plastic.

CaseWhile many gaming notebooks are rather unobtrusive and restrained in their overall design, save for maybe some keyboard backlight extravaganza, the Asus Dash F15 is clearly designed to appeal to extroverts instead. Its striking design and, most importantly, the ginormous TUF logo on the display lid are clear indicators for its gaming heritage and prowess. With that said it’s important to note that its predecessors were even more playful. Our review unit was clad in Eclipse Gray. A much more distinct and eye-catching color choice is Moonlight White, which will be an option for this series. Take a look at the ROG Zephyrus G15 to get a glimpse of what’s to come.Quality was improved leaps and bounds compared to its predecessors, see for example the metal display lid. However, there is still some room for improvement. Asus deserves particular praise for the device’s superb build quality as we found no inconsistencies or ill-fitted parts on our review unit whatsoever.

Another benefit is the Dash F15’s compact case design. At just 19.9 mm it is agreeably flat and in line with its competitors. Combined with its low weight of just 2.0 kg (4.4 lbs) this 15-inch laptop is definitely a hot candidate for our thin and light gaming laptop top list.The hinges are solid and firm and managed to hold the display in place without any major teetering, albeit their maximum opening angle is fairly limited (compare that to the Zephyrus G15’s full 180 degrees). Case rigidity is mostly solid save for a not particularly sturdy and thus somewhat wobbly display lid.

ConnectivityPortsThe selection of ports offered by the Asus TUF Dash F15 is up to date. Unlike the Zephyrus G15 that lacks Thunderbolt connectivity due to its AMD processor the more affordable sibling received a single Thunderbolt 4 port with USB 4.0 Type-C, DisplayPort 1.4a, and 100 W Power Delivery capabilities. It also features an HDMI 2.0 port, three USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, an audio jack, a Kensington lock, and even an RJ45 ethernet port seldom to be found on laptops this thin these days.Given that most ports are located at the front on the left-hand side this notebook is made primarily for right-handed users (re: use of an external mouse). Unfortunately, the device lacks a card reader and, more importantly, a webcam. Given the times we are in we honestly fail to grasp what Asus was thinking.









CommunicationWireless communications are handled by Intel’s Wi-Fi 6 AX201 modem. As the name suggests this module supports Bluetooth 5 as well as 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax Wi-Fi. When benchmarked at a distance of 1 m away from our Netgear Nighthawk AX12 reference router the Dash F15 performed adequately overall, although its transmit performance was rather poor and only good enough for last place.

AccessoriesIncluded in the box is a not particularly large 200 W 500 g (1.1 lbs) power supply.MaintenanceMaintenance options can be considered acceptable overall. While removing the bottom cover requires undoing a total of 15 Phillips screws it can then be easily disassembled once this arduous task has been completed. As you can see on the photos below you get access to the battery, the Wi-Fi modem, a single RAM slot, two M.2 slots, and the cooling system consisting of two fans connected by numerous intertwining heat pipes.WarrantyWarranty depends on country of purchase. European customers get 24 months while US customers are limited to just 12 months.Input DevicesKeyboardApart from its backlight (turquoise instead of white) and its translucent WASD keys the keyboard is identical to that of the Zephyrus G15, including all of its respective pros and cons. While accentuation point and keystroke made for a nice compromise between soft and hard that we enjoyed very much the keyboard layout itself is not particularly sensible, at least on the German model we had in review. Take for example the single-spaced return key or the missing Insert and Print keys. The missing numpad will certainly be a point of contention, much unlike the fact that the Dash F15’s arrow keys are simply too tiny to be used as controls for computer games BacklightTouchpadThe touchpad worked well overall. Its smooth surface offered practically no resistance to our fingertips and its surface was adequately large. Since it is of the clickpad variety without dedicated buttons both left and right click are embedded into the surface itself. Gestures are obviously supported as well, such as for example two-finger zoom or two-finger scrolling, although the latter was not as smooth as expected here and there. Overall precision was immaculate.DisplayOur review unit was equipped with a 240 Hz FHD panel. All things considered the screen was adequate, although its maximum brightness of just 275 nits is not bright enough for outdoor usage and therefore restricts its users to stay indoors.

Display Response TimesℹDisplay response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting). Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.   ↔    Response Time Black to White10 ms ... rise ↗ and fall ↘ combined↗ 5.6 ms rise↘ 4.4 ms fallThe screen shows good response rates in our tests, but may be too slow for competitive gamers.In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.1 (minimum) to 240 (maximum) ms. » 18 % of all devices are better.This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (22.3 ms).   ↔    Response Time 50% Grey to 80% Grey12 ms ... rise ↗ and fall ↘ combined↗ 6.8 ms rise↘ 5.2 ms fallThe screen shows good response rates in our tests, but may be too slow for competitive gamers.In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.25 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. » 17 % of all devices are better.This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (35.2 ms).


Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)ℹTo dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) . This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.Screen flickering / PWM detected 23580 Hz ≤ 30 % brightness settingThe display backlight flickers at 23580 Hz (Likely utilizing PWM) Flickering detected at a brightness setting of 30 % and below. There should be no flickering or PWM above this brightness setting.The frequency of 23580 Hz is quite high, so most users sensitive to PWM should not notice any flickering.In comparison: 53 % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 18889 (minimum: 5 - maximum: 3846000) Hz was measured.

Test ConditionsUsing the preinstalled Armoury Crate software users can adjust system performance in various ways. We enabled the Performance profile to run our benchmarks, which should offer a decent balance between performance, power consumption, and temperature as well as noise emissions. Whether or not our theory held true will be revealed later on.Armoury CratePerformanceThe Asus TUF Dash F15 FX516P is a high-end 15-inch gaming notebook. Our review unit was well-equipped for years to come as long as you refrain from connecting it to high-resolution displays (WQHD/UHD). Its processor, on the other hand, might become the primary bottleneck sooner or later due to its low core count.








ProcessorAfter many years of not being able to compete with AMD in regard to manufacturing processes Intel’s Tiger Lake finally caught up with its main Ryzen competitors again as it is manufactured in a more up to date 10 nm instead of the previous 14 nm process. This should in theory improve energy efficiency. Unfortunately, there were no six or eight-core Tiger Lake notebook CPUs available at the time of writing, and mobile Tiger Lake was thus limited to quad-core CPUs only.Single-core rendering
Multi-core renderingOur review unit’s Core i7-11370H comes with 8 MB of L3 cache and a TDP of up to 35 W. It can process up to 8 threads simultaneously thanks to Hyper-threading and can turbo boost up to 4.8 GHz, as already mentioned in the beginning of this article. With load on all four cores, it is still capable of up to a very decent 4.3 GHz. When subjected to our Cinebench loop the Dash F15 showed a relatively consistent sustained performance, at least after the first few iterations.

Despite its excellent single-core performance that turned out to be significantly higher than on previous Comet Lake generations in some cases our Core i7-11370H unsurprisingly failed to keep up with hexa and octa-core CPUs. It was outperformed by the Core i7-10875H commonly used in gaming notebooks, the less common Core i9-10980HK, and obviously also the 35 W Ryzen 9 5900HS that can be found in the Zephyrus G15. From a price-performance perspective a Ryzen 5 4600H or similar would have been a much better fit for the Dash F15.

DPC LatenciesDespite the fact that the Dash F15 showed the second-best latencies of all devices in our comparison group the 15-inch laptop might still wreak havoc on some real-time applications according to LatencyMon. This, however, would most likely not be an issue for most users and only affect a very specific subgroup.

Storage DevicesAsus’s storage device of choice is a 1 TB SK Hynix NVMe SSD. Interestingly enough the exact same SSD performed up to 30 % faster in the Zephyrus G15. Nevertheless, the Dash F15 ran smooth and fast (boot times, application launch times, file transfers, etc.) overall. If you need more storage space, you have the option to install a secondary M.2 SSD.

GPU PerformanceAs we already explained in our RTX 3070 Laptop and RTX 3080 Laptop performance test article Nvidia no longer uses the Max-Q moniker with their current Ampere generation of GPUs. Instead, OEMs can more or less freely configure TDP to their liking within certain thresholds. For the RTX 3070 Laptop these are 80 W on the low and 125 W on the high end, plus Dynamic Boost. Compare that to the RTX 3070 desktop GPU’s 220 W.

For the Dash F15, Asus chose the most energy efficient but also slowest configuration, as can be seen among others in our synthetic GPU benchmarks. In the Fire Strike, Time Spy, and Port Royal benchmark it performed practically identical to an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q GPU. Quite frankly, we would have expected more of a brand-new generation of GPUs. A prime example of what this GPU is capable of can be found in the XMG Neo 17, for which Schenker chose to configure its RTX 3070 Laptop at the upper level of the TDP threshold resulting in an up to 40 % higher performance when compared to the Dash F15. Keep in mind that a higher TDP usually also results in increased noise emissions.

Gaming PerformanceEven at just 80 W TDP the RTX 3070 Laptop was fast enough to run almost all games smoothly at the panel’s native FHD resolution in maximum details. Only extremely demanding titles, such as Watch Dogs Legion, Cyberpunk 2077, Crysis Remastered, or Red Dead Redemption 2 will fail to run with more than 60 FPS.

EmissionsNoise EmissionsDespite its low core count and its GPU’s low TDP the TUF Dash F15 can get very loud under load. Even though the fans will only produce a sound pressure level of up to 41 dB(A) when subjected to 3D load, they jump up to a very loud and annoying 48-54 dB(A) regularly. Idle performance on the other hand was impeccable, and they produced at most 30 dB(A) of sound pressure if they happened to be running at all.

When subjected to our stress test running Prime95 and FurMark the device warmed up to around 55 °C at the top and 56 °C at the bottom. Please note that peak temperatures were even higher during our Witcher 3 test due to higher clock speeds. Internal temperatures were kept in check by the cooling system and peaked at 70 °C and 80 °C for GPU and CPU after 60 minutes of full load, respectively.The Witcher 3

Energy ManagementPower ConsumptionPower consumption was relatively low and better than on its competitors, courtesy of the Dash F15’s low CPU core count. At 9 to 16 W when idle and 107 to 162 W under load its power consumption to performance ratio was acceptable and remained below the power supply’s rated load capacity.

Battery LifeThe Dash F15’s highlight is its long battery life. Thanks to among others Nvidia Optimus graphics switching the 15-inch device lasted for a good 16 hours in our idle test – a great result for a gaming laptop. It also performed very well when subjected to our real-world Wi-Fi test simulating typical web browsing load at a normalized brightness and lasted for an impressive 9 hours. Again, excellent for a gaming notebook.

VerdictTUF Dash F15 FX516P. Review unit provided by Asus GermanyWithout a doubt, the Asus TUF Dash F15 FX516P has its pros.In addition to its fast albeit slightly dim 240 Hz display its benefits also include a very long battery life capable of outshining even most office notebooks.We also like the fact that it comes with USB 4 and Thunderbolt support with 100 W Power Delivery charging.However, graphics performance will be a sore point, and we would sincerely advise you not to expect too much. As mentioned above Asus configured the RTX 3070 Laptop at the lowest possible TDP threshold thereby hampering its performance potential massively. In addition, a CPU with just four cores at the Dash F15’s price point is no longer state-of-the-art in 2021. An affordable AMD hexa-core CPU would have been a much better fit.Asus should also consider improving temperature and noise emissions under 3D load, and we would also like to add a webcam to our wish list for the Dash F15’s successor.Price and AvailabilityOur review unit was listed at 1,999 Euros in Germany, although we expect availability to be very limited in the months to come. Asus has not yet officially announced prices for the US.
